            Hello! I'm Kassidy Shedd, and I recently graduated with a Master of Science in 
            Robotics from Northwestern University in September 2024. Prior to that, I earned
            my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from New Mexico State University 
            in 2023. 
            <br><br>
            I'm particularly passionate about the intersection of robotics, healthcare, and 
            rehabilitation, with a focus on surgical robots, exo-skeletons, companion robots, 
            autonomous systems, and the integration of robotics with computer vision for real-world
            applications. 
            <br>Throughout my academic career, I have gained experience in key areas such as 
            ROS/ROS2, MoveIt, Python, C++, and machine learning models.
            <br><br>
            My goal is to continue developing innovative robotic systems that can enhance quality of 
            life, particularly in healthcare and rehabilitation.
