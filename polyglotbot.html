                Project Description<br>
            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                The Polyglotbot is a 7-DOF Franka robot arm utilizes OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to decipher 
                handwritten words in any language along with a corresponding language code. Subsequently, it utilizes the 
                Google Translate API to translate the word into the language specified by the code. The translated word is 
                then processed by a "string to waypoint" node, generating the necessary waypoints to outline each character 
                of the word. These waypoints are transmitted to the robot, prompting it to move to the whiteboard, and write 
                the translated word. <br>
                
                Additionally, the robot speakes  the original word in its native language before 
                articulating it in the translated language. April tags affixed to the whiteboard assist the robot in determining 
                the best distance from the whiteboard for optimal writing capabilities. Furthermore, the robot offers an option for 
                individuals to verbally communicate a word in any language. Afterward, the robot transcribes and writes the translated 
                word in English on the whiteboard.<br>
                
                Upon startup, the robot will retrieve an expo marker from a designated location, and on
                shutdown, the robot will return the marker to that designated location. 
                The OCR is triggered using YOLO to detect if a person has approached to write a word on the whiteboard. Once the person has been 
                detected and has moved away, the robot will initiate its workflow. This process repeats after each translation cycle, allowing for 
                multiple translation cycles in a row<br>

                This project utilizes one Intel RealSense Camera for OCR of the handwritten word and language code on the whiteboard. YOLO (Real-time
                object detection for ROS) is employed to determine if there is a person in the vicinity of the robot. If a person is present, the 
                robot will not move until they have left the area. <br>

            <div class="cont">
                The handwritten word and language code are processed using the Google Translate API, resulting in the translation of the handwritten 
                word into the language specified by the language code. The translated word and language code are then returned as a string. <br>

            <div class="cont">
                The string-to-waypoints package takes in the translated string and language code, returning a list of waypoints corresponding to how 
                to write the letters. This package uses matplotlib to create these waypoints. <br>

                The write_letters package utilizes a custom ROS2 move_it API to control the Franka arm. The waypoints are processed through the 
                motion_plan_package to command the robot arm to move along a Cartesian path, facilitating the writing of letters<br>
